# Portfolio Website

This portfolio website was created to present my projects and provide my contact details. The site features three main sections:

- **Welcome Section:** Introduces the visitor with a personal greeting.
- **Projects Section:** Displays a grid of project cards (e.g., JS Calculator, Library, Poke Search App) that reveal links on hover.
- **Contact Section:** Offers social media icons and contact information, including a secure email decryption feature.

The design emphasizes responsiveness and smooth navigation on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
